## Introduction

This is an exploratory analysis of air quality reports for Catalonia region, updated as of 02/05/2025. Data is downloaded from the [open data portal](https://administraciodigital.gencat.cat/ca/dades/dades-obertes/inici/index.html#googtrans(ca|en)) of Catalan Government (Generalitat de Catalunya), and includes hourly air quality metrics as well as geospatial information of the capture points.

The objective of this analysis is to find the biggest contributors to air pollution.
